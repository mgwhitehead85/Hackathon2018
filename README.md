# Hackathon2018

For this Hackathon project our group was tasked with reading in a file for the curriculum offered by Front Range Community College in
a given semester. The website details across Colorado can often be out of date, so we were additionally tasked to scrape a group of
websites then compare what was listed against the official curriculum of FRCC.

We were ultimately unsuccessful (due mainly to time constraints), but this was a really fun project and an excellent lesson
in teamwork and delegation.
